# Writing extensions

Albert can be extended by writing native C++/Qt plugins or Python plugins.
A quick comparison:

- [Native plugins](/docs/gettingstarted/extension/cplusplus):
  - Performance and power of C++.
  - Access to Qt and its eventloop.
  - Dynamic config widgets.
- [Python plugins](/docs/gettingstarted/extension/python):
  - Simplicity of Python.
  - Rapid prototyping.
  - Easy to distribute/share.
  - Only a subset of the internal API.
