This release contains the latest fixes and two new Python extensions:

* Datetime. (Time display and conversion. Supersedes the external extension)
* Bitfinex. (Quickly access Bitfinex markets)

The file browse mode finally mimics bash completion behavior.

Check the [git log](https://github.com/albertlauncher/albert/commits/v0.14.19) for details.

Further I want to let you know that I will stop posting news on [patch releases](https://semver.org/).
I'll try to move changes that are recognizeable by users into minor releases.
Note that there are no major releases at the moment since albert is still alpha.
