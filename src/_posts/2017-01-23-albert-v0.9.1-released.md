# {{ page.title }}

This release was intended to contain only fixes.
However there are some minor nifty changes recognizable by the user.
- Although not planned to be made official you can scan your files by typing albert scan files. Note that this feature may disappear someday.
- You can choose the terminal command in the settings dialog. The list shows all installed terminals. If you like you can provide a custom command.
- The app icon now uses a theme icon.
- Items of the files extension have now an "Open terminal here" action.

Check the [git log](https://github.com/albertlauncher/albert/commits/v0.9.1) for details.
