Note that there have been some breaking changes. The new plugin id format changed settings keys and config/cache/data paths. If you want to keep your old plugin settings you have to adjust the section names in the config file and adjust the paths in your config/cache/data dirs. (e.g. from `org.albert.files` to `files`). I'd recommend to start from scratch though, since too much changed.
