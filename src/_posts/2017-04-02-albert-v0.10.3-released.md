This release contains the latest fixes.

Due to problems with the indexing (\#419) the terminal extension changed. The extension does no more show suggestions, but a single item to run your command instead. Further the default action is now "Run in terminal". However the "Run in shell" action is still available in the alternative actions.

Check the [git log](https://github.com/albertlauncher/albert/commits/v0.10.2) for details.
