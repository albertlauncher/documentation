Finally there are official repositories other than the Arch Linux User Repositories hosted on the openSUSE Build Service platform. The openSUSE Build Service is the public instance of the Open Build Service (OBS). It builds software for several distributions and architectures in an automated fashion and hosts repositories for the built packages. This means that as soon as a new albert version is released the build service gets triggered to build albert and as soon it is finished, you will be able to get the latest version of albert. Check the [albert package on openSUSE Build Service](https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/home:manuelschneid3r/albert) to see the supported platforms.
