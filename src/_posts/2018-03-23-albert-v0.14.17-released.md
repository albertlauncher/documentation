This release contains the latest fixes, minor improvements to the extensions and a new Python extension.

With the new Python extension _Arch Wiki_ you can search the wiki.archlinux.org mediawiki and directly access articles.

The applications extension got two new options: _Use keywords for lookup_ and _Use generic name for lookup_. _Keywords_ and _GenericName_ are keys in the desktop entry whose values can be used for lookup.

The _kvstore_ extension was renamed to _Snippets_ and got an improved config UI.

Check the [git log](https://github.com/albertlauncher/albert/commits/v0.14.17) for details.
