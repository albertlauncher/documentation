This release contains the latest fixes. Further the following minor things changed:

- The web searches can not be enabled/disabled anymore as fallbacks. There will be a more generic mechanism that is responsible for that.
- URLs starting with `http` and `https` skip the TLD validation. This way you can access e.g. host in the LAN.
- The files extension **does not** require at least three chars anymore. Make sure you set your file filters correctly.
- <kbd>Home</kbd> and <kbd>End</kbd> now work for the results list holding <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>.

Check the [git log](https://github.com/albertlauncher/albert/commits/v0.11.2) for details.
