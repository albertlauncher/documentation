This release introduces rich text for item texts. Extensions using the offline index do not use it yet, since computing the matching substring is a bit more involved.

The TermAction now has a new option to set the behavior when the process exited. (Close, Close on success, Don not close).

This version ships with two new python extension: One interfacing the Arch User Repositories and another adapting scrot, a screenshot tool (credits go to Benedict Dudel).

As always the release also contains the latest fixes and minor improvements.

Check the [git log](https://github.com/albertlauncher/albert/commits/v0.14.13) for details.
