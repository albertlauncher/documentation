This release contains the latest fixes and new Python extensions:

* CoinMarketCap. Quickly view/access coins/tokens on CoinMarketCap.
* Trash extension. Adds an item that opens the trash bin in the file manager.
* Pomodoro extension. Tool to apply the focus and flow enhancing technique.
* Epoch extension. Simply shows current or translates unix timestamps.
* Packagist extension. Search for PHP packages on [Packagist](https://packagist.org/).

Futher the python API has been extended by three functions: `configLocation()`, `dataLocation()` and `cacheLocation()`. Therefore the minor API version increased. The interface identifier is now **PythonInterface/v0.2**. Note that the Python extension guarantees backward compatibility on minor version changes.

Check the [git log](https://github.com/albertlauncher/albert/commits/v0.14.15) for details.
