[albert]
* Remove the visual warning on crashes.
  This ICE error bug is going to stay around for a while.
* Remove autostart option
  This is a feature unnecessary complicated to maintain and perfectly fine
  to delegate entirely to the desktop environment.
* Add "report" RPC
  To get the ability to fetch report from the running instance.

[plugins]
* [python:2.1.0]
  Make plugin major.minor the interface version
  Improve UX while installing dependencies
* [calc:1.4] Threadsafe and aborting calculations
  libcalculate does not mention any thread safety. lock it.
  Use async calculate(â€¦) function and poll query validity to abort
  unnecessary calculations. This does not only save resources, but is
  also required such that the locks above dont introduce stuttering.
* [system:1.8] Dont prompt on gnome session logout
* [app_xdg:1.8] Use Ubuntu gettext domains

[python]
* [bitwarden] 2.0
  Add copy-username action
