If you found here, you are probably thinking about donating some bucks for the development of your favorite keyboard launcher ;D That's great. Thank you. It makes me happy to know that people are grateful for what I (love to) do, and I highly appreciate that you are thinking about a donation.

These are the services you can use to donate. I want to make it simple, so if you think the list below is missing something let me know.

* SEPA wire transfer:

  Regular wire transfer in the euro area is free of any fees. Publishing an IBAN is a bad idea, but I plan to embed it in the app. For now please contact me. Preferably via [Telegram](https://t.me/manuelschneider).

* GitHub sponsorship (No fees, implicit VAT):

  Visit my [GitHub sponsorship page.](https://github.com/sponsors/ManuelSchneid3r)

* Crypto (Transaction cost vary depending on the coin/token):

  You can also dontate coins or tokens. Most of them are pretty cost effective. If you are into crypto currencies, I guess you know how much a transaction of a particular coin/token costs. Below is a list of wallets of popular coins. For others contact me. Preferably via [Telegram](https://t.me/manuelschneider).

* PayPal (Caution: High fees for small donations):

  Paypal charges at least .3$ fixed plus 2,49% of the total transferred amount. For small pledges fees can grow up to 30-40%. If you want to use PayPal anyway, [click here](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=W74BQPKPGNSNC).

* Patreon (Caution: High fees for small donations, implicit VAT)

  Patreon [charges](https://support.patreon.com/hc/en-us/articles/360027674431-My-earnings-fees) 6% (5 in the US) plus fixed fees (.1$/.15€ below 3$, .3$/.35€ above 3$). For small pledges fees can get over 20%. Including the VAT regulators enforce, around half of the amount does not even end on my side.
