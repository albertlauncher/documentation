## Why would I want to donate?

First, if you can’t afford $1 per month, you should _not_ donate.
One of the main goals is to make Albert available to everyone, that’s why it’s free.
If you _can_ afford $1 per month, I’d like to ask you to step in for those who can’t.

To answer this question, you need to understand the burden of maintaining a project like this.
I spend an insane amount of time on Albert, and the effort goes far beyond my personal needs.
There are periods when tasks feel like work rather than enjoyment.
Note that this project is not backed by any foundation or organization.
A donation shows that you acknowledge this effort and are willing, out of gratitude, to help offset the cost I bear.

## What is this cost?

Time. Loads of time.

Beyond designing, developing, testing, and maintaining the core application and many plugins, actively or passively, 
I also handle packaging for almost all supported platforms. 
This alone is a complex task, given the combinations of distributions, architectures,
and the inconsistent feature support in compilers and standard libraries.
Ensuring that Albert builds everywhere is a major time sink.

I place strong emphasis on providing plugin authors with an excellent developer experience.
I design and continuously refine an API that is easy to understand, yet powerful and hard to break.
Writing clear, structured, and unambiguous documentation is just as important, and just as time-consuming.

A significant portion of the work happens in largely invisible areas:
For example, achieving outstanding performance while minimizing battery usage,
testing the latest language/toolkit features that eventually may end up unused, 
keeping the website up to date,
and dealing with the flaws of the ever-changing environment Albert interfaces.
As a result, I actively contribute to other projects by doing whatever is necessary to keep Albert running everywhere.

Beyond the technical work, I also try to build and organize a vibrant community of users and contributors,
and to provide user and developer support through community channels and GitHub whenever possible.

That's what I’ve been doing for over a decade to reduce your cognitive load and save your time.
