# Getting help

If you have questions or problems the community is there to help.
However to be fair we expect you to do your own research first.

1. Make sure your issue is in the scope of this project.
1. Google your issue.
1. Ask AI for help (e.g. [chatgpt.com](https://chatgpt.com/)). 
1. Search for similar existing issues.
1. If you need support ask for it in the community chats.
1. If you think you found a bug post an [issue]({{ site.repository }}/albert/issues).
